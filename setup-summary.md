- ✅ User login with JWT tokens
- ✅ Secure logout functionality
- ✅ Session management with localStorage
- ✅ Role-based access (patient, doctor, admin)

## 🚀 How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites
You'll need to have the following services running:
- MongoDB (for database)
- Redis (for caching and sessions)

### Quick Start

1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
   This will start the backend on port 3001

2. **Start the frontend (in a new terminal):**
   ```bash
   npm run client
   ```
   This will start the React app on port 3000

3. **Or run both simultaneously:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Access the Application
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3001

## 🎨 UI Features

### Landing Page
- Hero section with video background
- Typewriter animation for tagline
- Smooth scroll animations
- Responsive navigation

### Authentication
- Modal-based login/register form
- Real-time form validation
- Success/error message handling
- Secure token management

### Sections
- **Services**: Core features showcase
- **About**: Company statistics
- **Contact**: Contact form

## 🔧 API Endpoints

The frontend is configured to connect to these backend endpoints:

- `POST /api/v1/users/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/v1/users/login` - User login  
- `POST /api/v1/users/logout` - User logout
- `POST /api/v1/users/verifyUser` - OTP verification

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Database Setup**: Ensure MongoDB and Redis are running
2. **Email Configuration**: Update email settings in .env for OTP delivery
3. **Testing**: Test the authentication flow
4. **Deployment**: Configure for production deployment

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Backend not starting**: Check if MongoDB and Redis are running
2. **CORS errors**: Verify the CORS_ORIGIN in .env matches your frontend URL
3. **Authentication fails**: Check the JWT secrets in .env
4. **Port conflicts**: Ensure ports 3000 and 3001 are available

## 📱 Testing the Application

1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Click "Login / Sign Up" button
3. Try registering a new account
4. Test the login functionality
5. Explore the responsive design on different screen sizes

The application is now ready for development and testing! 🎉
